create a temporary bash alias to type some commands faster : 

touch alias.txt
vim alias.txt

on first line write for ex:
alias aa='./a.out'

then esc :wq to save and quit vim

open bash
run the following cmd :

. ./alias.txt

now when you type for ex : 

aa "whatever argv[1]" "whatever argv[2]"

then press enter key;

it will behave as if you did 

./a.out "whatever argv[1]" "whatever argv[2]"

then press enter key;
